Hello!  I'm a Canadian currently living in San Francisco.

Professionally, I'm interested in information security, systems programming,
cryptography, networking, and more.

I currently work for [Square](https://squareup.com) in the Information Security
organization.
Prior to that I worked for [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com) as a
software engineer.  I have a degree from the University of Waterloo in Computer
Science.  I interned at Mozilla, Amazon, Endeca, Performance Technologies,
eSentire, and WeCreate.

If you'd like to contact me, you can do so by email.  Use my first name at this
domain name as the address.
