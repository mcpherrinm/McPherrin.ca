Hello!  I'm a Canadian currently living in San Francisco.

Professionally, I'm interested in Information Security, systems programming,
devops, and more.  I currently work for [Square](https://squareup.com) in the
Information Security organization.
Prior to that I worked for [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com) as a
software engineer.  I have a degree from the University of Waterloo in Computer
Science.

If you'd like to contact me, you can do so by email.  Use my first name at this
domain name as the address.
