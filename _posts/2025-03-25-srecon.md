title: Ten Years as a Free, Open, and Automated Certificate Authority
---

This talk was given at SRECon25 Americas.

Ubiquitous HTTPS is an essential part of a secure and privacy-respecting Internet. To that end, the public benefit
certificate authority Let’s Encrypt has been issuing TLS certificates free of cost in a reliable, automated, and
trustworthy manner for ten years. In that time, we’ve grown to servicing over 500,000,000 websites.

In this talk we’ll dive into the history of Let’s Encrypt and share helpful context for those managing TLS certificates,
as well as information about upcoming changes to Let’s Encrypt and guidance for the future. We’ll also cover how we have
strived to make the working lives of SREs around the world easier, and how the SRE community has helped us in return.
