I have decided to set up a blog to organize and share things I do, just like
everyone else's blogs.  I've made several decisions in how I'd like my blog to
work.

The first is that I want to use a static site generator and store the content
in source control.  As a software developer I'm very comfortable with the edit,
run, CI and CD flow.  I can write in the same editor I always use.  I can make
local changes offline, test pages, and deploy when ready.

A statically generated website is easy to host anywhere.  I'm using Github and
Github Pages because it's convenient and free, but I could easily switch to AWS
CodePipeline publishing to S3, or a docker container with Nginx serving the
static content.  And a git repo is easy to continually back up.  I've lost a
bunch of websites over the years, and while there's bits in archive.org, I
don't want that to happen again.  

Github pages dictates the use of Jekyll.  It seems to work well, in my limited
experience so far.  I made a base page layout, an index page, and a post one.
I could use a theme from somewhere, but I don't get to make webpages often, so
I'll do it from scratch.  It'll probably be pretty ugly, but it'll be mine.
