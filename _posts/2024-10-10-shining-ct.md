title: Shining a new light on Certificate Transparency
---

This talk was given at the transparency.dev summit 2024.

Let’s Encrypt operates one of the largest Certificate Authorities, along with Certificate Transparency logs. This talk
discusses our experiences both as a submitter to CT as well as a log operator. We are excited about the new Sunlight log
implementation, and will cover why we think Sunlight will be a good fit for us and for the larger CT ecosystem.
