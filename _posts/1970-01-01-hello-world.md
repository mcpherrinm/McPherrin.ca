This is a test post.  I am testing this.  It has much text, with many words. I
hope that in the future, these words have meaning and substance.  But for now
they do not.  They are simply a collection of uninteresting phrases.  What is
the definition of interesting?

If a thermometer tells you a figure, how do you know if you can trust it?  Is
the measurement more important than your own experience of the weather?  Why do
we need to measure the temperature?  Should a description not suffice?

I saw some good dogs today.
